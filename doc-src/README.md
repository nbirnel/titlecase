Inspiration and History
---------

This is partially inspired and informed by John Gruber's titlecase: 
<http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case>
and Sam Souder's ruby implementation:
<https://github.com/samsouder/titlecase>

I didn't like a few of the rules in Gruber's version, though.
Major differences are:
  - don't ever downcase anything
  - the last word doesn't get upcased if it is on the exclude list
  - the exclude list is slightly different
  - colons get no special treatment
